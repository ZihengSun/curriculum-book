# 2.1 Data Definition

Geoscientific data is particularly diverse: point measurements of soil moisture, high rate time series (1000 samples per second) seismograms, rasterized LandSAT imagery, Geospatial and Temporal simulated geophysical fields.

**The data modality** refer to the field, or genre of measurements. Different modalities may be seismograms, GPS displacement time series, surface air temperature time series. All of them are point-based measurements, share the same data type (1D arrays), could be saved in the same data format (e.g., CSV file), but sense different physical fields.

**The data type** refers to the type of an object. Geoscientific data is mostly *numeric* (floats, integer) and from which you can calculate things. 

**The data format** refers to the specific type of parsing schema in a file (H5, CSV, JSON). It can be binary (H5), using standard character encodings (CSV, JSON), compressed (H5, Parquet), ... more details in Chapter 2.5.

The difference in dimensionalities among geoscientific data challenges the design of machine learning models across disciplines. For most machine-learning practictioner, data modalities are classified as **dimension**. One example is a geophysical model that uses sattelite imagery (2D in space) with time series (1D in time) from point-based sensor measurements to predict an output.

Machine Learning can handle multi-modal analysis. It borrows technique from Data Fusion.
